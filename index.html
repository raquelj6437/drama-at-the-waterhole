             The dusty ground is covered in shrubs as far as the eye can see... The waterhole is the hub, the meeting place. The animals from all around the Savanna come together to rehydrate in the cooling water of the waterhole. One day, something disastrous happens; the waterhole dries up! Who is to blame for this devastating rare occurrence? Where will the animals of the Savanna go? How will they find the culprit? Watch this epic tale of survival, loyalty and greed. <br>
